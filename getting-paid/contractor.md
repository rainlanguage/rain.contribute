# Getting paid to work on Rain as a contractor

We have a lot of work to do on Rain in the following areas:

- Rust development
  - Tooling that interfaces with the onchain contracts for product development
    - Compiled to WASM used in the browser SDK
    - Native Rust tooling
  - Infrastructure that directly interacts with onchain contracts
    - Solvers that find and execute arbitrage opportunities on Raindex
- Typescript development
  - Product develoment that uses the Rust/WASM SDK to present GUIs for end users
- Solidity/YUL development
  - Smart contract development and testing

## Expectations

These expectations are not hard requirements, but they do go a long way in your
favour if you want us to be paying you for regular work.

### Be ready

We expect you to give yourself the skills and experience needed to do the job.

We're not going to teach you Rust, or DEFI or whatever. If you want to work on
those things with us, the responsibility sits with you to have those skills
before we start assigning tasks.

In short, we're only paying for DEFI professionals to build market ready
products.

### Using Rain and/or Rain ecosystem products and/or DEFI generally

It would be weird if you applied to work at Facebook without a Facebook profile,
or Netflix if you never watched shows.

Similarly, it is a bit weird if you want to work on Rain as a dev but have no
experience with the things we're building as a user, or at the least DEFI
products in general.

Experience is something you only get by doing things repeatedly over a long time.

### Fit the work that needs doing

At any time, we have very specific work that needs doing in order to meet
deadlines, clear out bottlenecks, etc.

We have to focus on only these items, so the team needs to be capable of
delivering what is in front of them as it is needed.

While there may be other items in the backlog that you might be able to cherry
pick, it actually leads to distractions for other team members who have to
manage, review, and incorporate this work. If cherry picking from the backlog
becomes normalized rather than focussing on the main line, the disruption ends
up being more detrimental than the value added by the tasks.

### Communicate

We work remotely, so the importance of regular communiciation is extremely high.

If we worked in the same office, we could simply see each other and chat whenever
something comes up during the day.

Don't underestimate the skill and importance of replicating this as much as
possible in the digital mediums, e.g. Telegram chats.

If we don't see you in Telegram talking about your work as you're doing it, we
typically assume there is no work being done.

### Follow the contribution guidelines

Of course it's even more important that paid members of the Rain ecosystem follow
all the contribution guidelines in this repository.

You need to both follow and set an example for all to follow.
